## Reflection
It was a three-week-long project. We started from scratch at first on the backend where we created the base project on https://start.spring.io/ and cloned it into our project into IntelliJ IDEA ULTIMATE. 
The frontend part was created in Webstorm USING THE COMMAND npx create-react-app frontend. The main page is more of a presentation of the website.
On http://localhost:3000/auxiliary is the entire list of pages with stored data. Each page has create, update, and delete buttons.

## Challenges
